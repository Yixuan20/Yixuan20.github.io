<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a junior student at Beijing Forestry University, majored in product design at the School of Art and Design while minoring in Computer Art at the School of Information Science and Technology. I will be pursuing a master‚Äôs degree in Electronic Information at Tsinghua University in 2025.

I have research experience at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Tsinghua University's Future Lab, and the Southern University of Science and Technology, along with work experience at BMW (China) Service Co., Ltd. These experiences have helped me develop a foundation in interdisciplinary fields, showcasing my ability to integrate research with design and promote technological innovation.

I am interested in human-computer interaction (HCI), specifically in the design of tangible interfaces, wearables, and haptic feedback.
