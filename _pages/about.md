<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a senior undergraduate studentr student at Beijing Forestry University, majored in product design, School of Art and Design, minoring in Computer Art, School of Information Science and Technology. I will be pursuing a master‚Äôs degree in Electronic Information at Tsinghua University in 2025.

I have research experience at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Computational Media and Arts (CMA)](https://cma.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), [Future Laboratory, Tsinghua University ](https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), and the [Southern University of Science and Technology, School of Design](https://designschool.sustech.edu.cn/), along with work experience at [BMW (China) Service Co., Ltd](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2019/china-fe.html). These experiences have helped me build a strong foundation in interdisciplinary fields, fostering my ability to integrate research with design and drive technological innovation.

I am interested in human-computer interaction (HCI), specifically in the design of tangible interfaces, wearables, and haptic feedback.

# üé® Design

- 2025.4 "See Diversity" Digital Media Art Exhibition-Mycelium Spectrum

- <p style="color: rgba(97, 97, 97, 0.7);font-size: 14px;"> Inspired by the artwork of children from diverse genealogies and my observations of mushroom morphology, I realized that each individual shines with an irreplaceable life force. Seemingly independent entities are interconnected through a hidden mycelial network, facilitating nutrient exchange and information flow, thus forming a complex ecosystem. The work uses mushrooms as a metaphor and employs tactile installations to simulate the flow of energy within the mycelial network, inviting the audience to reconsider the boundaries of groups in human society. The so-called 'circles' defined by society are not isolated islands, but rather dynamic, interconnected life networks, where each unique individual can remain authentic while becoming a crucial node in sustaining the system's operation. </p>
